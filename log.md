//**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

//**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Friday, July 31st, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished 24/110 modules from the Basic JavaScript module on freeCodeCamp.org.

**Thoughts** I really need to find a C# project I can work on to get me used to working in Visual Studio and with the ASP.NET MVC architecture.
I started looking on Reddit for C# projects but it feels so overwhelming trying to find something that is going to utilize Javascript, HTML, CSS and C# and help get me up to speed with MVC design principles.
I am super excited for my boss to return from vacation and help get my work computer set up. I need to commit to finding a project to work on by end of day this Sunday, August 2nd.
